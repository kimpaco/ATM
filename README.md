# ATM

DESCRIPTION
My simple ATM using React. It has a few basic functionalities:
-Tracks the state of your account balance through the use of useState.
-Will not allow you to withdraw beyond the limits of your current balance.
-Simplified the function by removing the "submit button" and instead using the "deposit" and "withdraw" buttons to directly carry out the operation.
-Fixed the issue where the input field value would be defaulted to $0 after each transaction.
